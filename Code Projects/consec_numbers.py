"""Sum of Consecutive Numbers


No one likes homework, but your math teacher has given you an assignment to find the sum of the first N numbers.
Letâ€™s save some time by creating a program to do the calculation for you!
Take a number N as input and output the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (including N).

Sample Input
100

Sample Output
5050

Explanation: The sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is equal to 5050."""

sum = 0

print("Input number :")
N = int(input())

list = range(0, N+1)

for x in list:
    sum += x

print("Calculating sum from 1 to", N)
print(sum)
